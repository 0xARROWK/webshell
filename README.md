## In which context did I this project?

After finishing a challenge using reverse shells on Root Me, it made me want to create my own, for use in this type of challenge.

## The goal of the project

The goal of this project is to create a single-page web shell that allows users to upload files, create, edit and delete files on the server while seeing in real time what is affected by these changes. The project is still under development and is not finished: you can only view the folders and files present as well as the website preview.

## Installation

No installation is required, for use this web shell you just have to clone this repo and use the `index.php` file :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xARK/webshell
```
